## What is Auth0?

Auth0 helps you to:

- Add authentication with [multiple authentication sources](https://docs.auth0.com/identityproviders), either social like **Google, Facebook, Microsoft Account, LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, Box, Salesforce, among others**, or enterprise identity systems like **Windows Azure AD, Google Apps, Active Directory, ADFS or any SAML Identity Provider**.
- Add authentication through more traditional **[username/password databases](https://docs.auth0.com/mysql-connection-tutorial)**.
- Add support for **[linking different user accounts](https://docs.auth0.com/link-accounts)** with the same user.
- Support for generating signed [Json Web Tokens](https://docs.auth0.com/jwt) to call your APIs and **flow the user identity** securely.
- Analytics of how, when and where users are logging in.
- Pull data from other sources and add it to the user profile, through [JavaScript rules](https://docs.auth0.com/rules).
